# GoodByeSL

GoodBye SL is a quick website I developed for fun to invite my late colleagues to a "Last day shower" :)
It is a little "game" made of 4 steps and 5 screens to discover when the shower will be given.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them :

* Python 3.4 or higher
* Django 2.0.2 or higher

### Limitations

GoodBye SL is a "one shot" app that I developed "as it is" :)
